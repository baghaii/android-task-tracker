that uses features including Toolbar, Fragments, and RecyclerView.

1. The subtitle state is not maintained when a task is selected and the up button is
used to return to the task list.
2. Hitting the up button when a task hasn't been filled in should make it so the new task is not 
created.
3. Learn to use the google API to integrate tasks with the Google Calendar.
